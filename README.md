## Objective:
Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the distribution of ages or genders in a population.

In my notebook, I have created 5 bar charts to visualize the population increase from the year 1960 to 2022 of 5 countries: 
1. India
2. Pakistan
3. Australia
4. United Arab Emirates
5. China

The dataset was downloaded from: https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL
